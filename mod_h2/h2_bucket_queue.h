/**
 * A queue, or ordered list, of h2_bucket structures with the additional
 * twist that it associates buckets with integer ids. It is possible to
 * retrieve buckets by their associated id.
 *
 * The queue is thread safe and allows blocking/non-blocking reads.
 * 
 * The buckets passed into the queue are not copied. The queue takes
 * ownership and will destroy all buckets when it is destroyed itself.
 * Buckets retrieved will be owned by the called.
 *
 * It is possible to push an "end-of-stream" for a integer id, signalling
 * that there will be no more buckets coming afterwards.
 *
 * The queue offers an event callback when buckets are placed into the
 * queue.
