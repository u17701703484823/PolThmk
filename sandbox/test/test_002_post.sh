# Caveat: on h2c, the connection will not be upgraded, since curl sends
# the POST as first request and mod_h2 does not upgrade on requests with
# content. Currently we have no means to check that his is happening.
# on curl 7.41.0 and earlier, the transfer of the upload data will be
# extremely slow. Fix will be in 7.42.0, thanks @badger!

# disable until 7.42.0 arrives....
