mod-h2 - a http/2 modules for apache httpd
==========================================
On how to build mod_h2.


Platforms
---------
mod_h2 has been developed under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and OS X 10.10. The module
itself depends only on an installed APXS (the Apache runtime platform) and
libnghttp2. As long as both are present, the module itself should build
just fine.


Runtime Dependencies
--------------------
- Apache httpd 2.4
  - for HTTP2 over TLS ("h2" variant) a patched mod_ssl is needed,
  see httpd/README, and the installed OpenSSL needs to be at least 1.0.1
- libnghttp2 (https://nghttp2.org), at least version 0.7.3


Build Dependencies
------------------
All of the above and an APXS (Apache runtime) matching the server version,
plus the nghttp2 include files.

if all this is installed on your system, just

  checkout> cd mod_h2
  checkout/mod_h2> make install



Test Setup Dependencies
-----------------------
If you build with the top level Makefile of the project, it will setup a
test environment with a local, patched httpd, the nghttp2 library and apps,
curl and possibly even openssl.

All this will be installed with ./gen/install as prefix, so there will be
a ./gen/install/bin/apachectl afterwards. Installed libraries will be in
./gen/install/lib etc. The Apache httpd configuration is placed in
./gen/install/conf

The Makefile will download several source tar balls, the exact number depends
on the local OS and installation. Some prerequisites have to be met which are
listed in the specific OS descriptions below:


Ubuntu
------
Install the prerequisite software:
  - pcre
  - openssl
  - pkg-config
  - libev-dev

  > sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev

...


OS X
----
On OS X 10.10, building the project requires a homebrew installation and
the following packages installed via brew:
  - pkg-config

* for httpd the Makefile will download and install:
  - pcre
  - apr + apr-util
  - openssl
  exact versions and download urls in httpd/Makefile

* for nghttp2 the Makefile will download and install:
  - zlib
  - libev
  exact versions and download urls in httpd/Makefile
