/**
 * A HTTP/2 connection, a session with a specific client.
 * 
 * h2_session sits on top of a httpd conn_rec* instance and takes complete
 * control of the connection data. It receives protocol frames from the
 * client. For new HTTP/2 streams it creates h2_task(s) that are sent
 * via callback to a dispatcher (see h2_conn.c).
 * h2_session keeps h2_io's for each ongoing stream which buffer the
 * payload for that stream.
 *
 * New incoming HEADER frames are converted into a h2_stream+h2_task instance
 * that both represent a HTTP/2 stream, but may have separate lifetimes. This
 * allows h2_task to be scheduled in other threads without semaphores
 * all over the place. It allows task memory to be freed independant of
 * session lifetime and sessions may close down while tasks are still running.
 *
