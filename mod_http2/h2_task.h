/**
 * A h2_task fakes a HTTP/1.1 request from the data in a HTTP/2 stream 
 * (HEADER+CONT.+DATA) the module receives.
 *
 * In order to answer a HTTP/2 stream, we want all Apache httpd infrastructure
 * to be involved as usual, as if this stream can as a separate HTTP/1.1
 * request. The basic trickery to do so was derived from google's mod_spdy
 * source. Basically, we fake a new conn_rec object, even with its own
 * socket and give it to ap_process_connection().
 *
 * Since h2_task instances are executed in separate threads, we may have
 * different lifetimes than our h2_stream or h2_session instances. Basically,
 * we would like to be as standalone as possible.
 *
 * Finally, to keep certain connection level filters, such as ourselves and
 * especially mod_ssl ones, from messing with our data, we need a filter
 * of our own to disable those.
