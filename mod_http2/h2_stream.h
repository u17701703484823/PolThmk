/**
 * A HTTP/2 stream, e.g. a client request+response in HTTP/1.1 terms.
 * 
 * A stream always belongs to a h2_session, the one managing the
 * connection to the client. The h2_session writes to the h2_stream,
 * adding HEADERS and DATA and finally an EOS. When headers are done,
 * h2_stream is scheduled for handling, which is expected to produce
 * a response h2_headers at least.
 * 
 * The h2_headers may be followed by more h2_headers (interim responses) and
 * by DATA frames read from the h2_stream until EOS is reached. Trailers
 * are send when a last h2_headers is received. This always closes the stream
 * output.
