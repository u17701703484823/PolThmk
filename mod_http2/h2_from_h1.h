/**
 * h2_from_h1 parses a HTTP/1.1 response into
 * - response status
 * - a list of header values
 * - a series of bytes that represent the response body alone, without
 *   any meta data, such as inserted by chunked transfer encoding.
 *
 * All data is allocated from the stream memory pool. 
 *
 * Again, see comments in h2_request: ideally we would take the headers
 * and status from the httpd structures instead of parsing them here, but
 * we need to have all handlers and filters involved in request/response
 * processing, so this seems to be the way for now.
