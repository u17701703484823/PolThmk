v0.4.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * heavy work on internal data transfers, use of apache bucket brigades for
   improved performance and parallelism
 * mod_h2 now performs proper flow-control on input. Uploads can no longer
   flood memory of the server.
 * changed mod_ssl patch to reflect current trunk changes in regard to NPN/ALPN
   support.
 * patched the trunk ALPN patch to make it do the right thing if no 
   ALPNPreference is configured
 * added DESTDIR support in Makefile as supplied by Hanno BÃ¶ck.

v0.4.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * adding more low-level logging to NPN/ALPN negotiation
 * added '-Werror' to module compiler flags (thanks @devurandom)

   platforms. If you experience connection hangers, report pls with 'trace2'
   level error log.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixing infinite loop when aborting session with tasks hanging in read

v0.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * h2 + h2-16 will be negiotiated/upgraded. Priority handling is implemented
   in nghttp2, however assigning requests to workers has currently not the
   necessary information.
 * Alt-Svc support based on https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/alt-svc.html#indicator
   Configuration directives "H2AltSvc" and "H2AltSvcMaxAge" added. Configurable
   per virtual host.
 * reduced lock contention and eliminated broadcast signalling on internal 
   condition variables, improved multi-thread performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * defining _GNU_SOURCE to pull in proper features and make APR header files
   happy, fixes #7 

v0.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new directory structure, all sandbox related parts have been moved to 
   own sandbox dir
 * non-sandbox configuration no longer triggers building of sandbox stuff

v0.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * optimizations on response reads
 * being more apacheeeish, using APR_RINGs for queue handling
 * using openssl latest.tar.gz to retrieve latest openssl for sandbox
 * fixed crash in large request header handling
 * better flushing of stream io resulting in performance improvements
 * added sandbox tests for chunked responses of various sizes
 * integrated fix (https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/pull/5) from 
   Jonathan (invader444) to fix chunked encoding when converting http/1
   responses to http2 unchunked data.

v0.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * changed apr_pool usage to have more recycling, 50% performance increase in 
   loadtest
 * added hack to enable mod_h2 to run in mpm_event (experimental)
 * changed internal stream/data lookup from O(n/2) to O(log(n)) time
 * fixed index in http2 to http1 header conversion leading to segfaults
 * update openssl version downloaded for sandbox
 * using sha256 for self-signed sandbox certificates
 * sandbox certificate no longer announces itself as roo

v0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * merged pull request from Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa, removing code for CONTINUATION
   frames that are never seen by mod_h2
 * request/response headers are filtered when converting between HTTP/1.1 and
   HTTP/2 where they can only do harm (Expect/Connection/etc.)
 * added test cases for uploads
 * fixed handling of uploads ;-)
 * enabled h2c upgrade for "OPTIONS *" requests
 * changed h2_stream_set implementation to use sorted apr array
 * switched to nghttp2 v0.7.7 in sandbox

v0.1.1
