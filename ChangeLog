v0.6.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * accepting "h2" on Upgrade: headers and allowing also Upgrade to work on TLS
   connections that talk HTTP/1.1.
 * logging WARNING once when mod_h2 is used in a "prefork" mpm configuration.
   There seem to be issues with mod_proxy/rewrite and dankging I/O.
 * added test suites for combinations with mod_proxy and mod_rewrite
 * added test for request with Host: header where h2 is not enabled
 * sandbox now builds local openssl 1.0.2 if 1.0.1 or older are installed
   on the system. Prior 1.0.1 was accepted, but NPN support will be disabled
   soon.
 * added "Known Problems" section in README
 * direct mode should also work with TLS connections, untested currently.

v0.6.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * h2c direct mode is now enabled on http: virtual hosts. It can be disabled
   by configuring "H2Direct off" for the base server. This works for clients
   with prior knowledge that a http server supports h2c.

v0.6.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * added "H2Direct (on|off)" as config directive. On a non-TLS host, it enables
   direct h2c communication without any Upgrade dance. Useful for testing, for
   example with h2load.
 * fixed concurrency issue observed on a mpm_event server when closing sessions

v0.6.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * relaxing task finished sync due to segfaults with mpm_event
 * mod_reqtimeout enabled on stream processing again
 * merged pr from ecovener, fix for ap_update_vhost_from_headers use
 * tinkering with buffering on main connection

v0.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fiddling around with task/worker assignments to use the global h2_workers
   lock less, giving better parallelism
 * ./configure --enable-werror enables all sorts of compiler diagnostics, if
   the chosen compiler supports them
 * merged pull request with compiler warning fixes by LPardue and @samhurst 
   (Thanks!)
 * new config option "H2SerializeHeaders (On|Off)" that determines if request
   response headers should be serialized/parsed when converting from HTTP/2 to
   httpd's internal HTTP/1 processing or request_recs are manipulated directly.
   "Off" is default, "On" gives better compatibility.
 * new config options "H2HackMpmEvent (On|Off) that enables a hack to make
   internal connection work with the mpm_event module. Has no effect if other
   mpm modules have been configured. Defaults to "On"."
 * upgrading sandbox to nghttp2 0.7.15

v0.5.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * making SSL variables available in subprocess (e.g. CGI) environments if
configured (fixes #19)

v0.5.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * improved transfer of large resources by 50% by more efficient writes

v0.5.4
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * moving request handling and http/1 emulation into worker thread, offloading 
   main
 * some fixes in connection shutdown re race condition with still active workers
 * removing reqtimeout filters on stream connections
 * taking in latest alpn changes from httpd trunk, made separate npn patch for
   those who need to run with openssl 1.0.1
 * fixed handling of transient bucket in stream output data (led to corrupted
   responses)
 * reworked task join to eliminate race conditions during session shutdown
 * info logging is less verbose

v0.5.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * rewrote the input handling
    * forwarding headers in camel case to HTTP/1 request prossing
    * merging duplicate headers into single line with proper separators
    * eliminated h2_bucket by using apr_bucket_brigades everywhere
    * added test cases and fixed chunked input processing
 * sandbox now uses curl 7.42.0
 * enhanced alpn patch slightly, compatible to old one, no need to repatch mod_ssl on existing installations
 * adding some tests with fcgi, for sandbox testing please install php5-cgi

v0.5.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ensuring HOST header is properly set for internal request handling
 * updated sandbox to latest nghttp2 release

v0.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * improved resource handling and performance
 * fixes lookup of correct server config when several virtual hosts are 
   available

v0.4.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixed base64 decoding to use correct dialect when upgrading to h2c

v0.4.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * adds missing file in distribution tar, fixes #11
 * sandbox now uses nghttp2 0.7.11

v0.4.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * heavy work on internal data transfers, use of apache bucket brigades for
   improved performance and parallelism
 * mod_h2 now performs proper flow-control on input. Uploads can no longer
   flood memory of the server.
 * changed mod_ssl patch to reflect current trunk changes in regard to NPN/ALPN
   support.
 * patched the trunk ALPN patch to make it do the right thing if no 
   ALPNPreference is configured
 * added DESTDIR support in Makefile as supplied by Hanno BÃ¶ck.

v0.4.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * adding more low-level logging to NPN/ALPN negotiation
 * added '-Werror' to module compiler flags (thanks @devurandom)

   platforms. If you experience connection hangers, report pls with 'trace2'
   level error log.

v0.4.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixing infinite loop when aborting session with tasks hanging in read

v0.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * h2 + h2-16 will be negiotiated/upgraded. Priority handling is implemented
   in nghttp2, however assigning requests to workers has currently not the
   necessary information.
 * Alt-Svc support based on https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/alt-svc.html#indicator
   Configuration directives "H2AltSvc" and "H2AltSvcMaxAge" added. Configurable
   per virtual host.
 * reduced lock contention and eliminated broadcast signalling on internal 
   condition variables, improved multi-thread performance
